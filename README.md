# Cafe-Menu - HTML and CSS Project

Welcome to the "Cafe-Menu" repository! This README provides an overview of the cafe website's HTML and CSS code, explaining the structure and purpose of each section.

## Screenshots and Explanations

### Main Structure

The main structure of the website consists of various sections that provide information about the cafe's menu and details. Here's a breakdown of the key HTML and CSS elements used:

### Header and Cafe Information

In the header, we use `<h1>` for the cafe's name, `<div>` containers for styling, and inline styles to set the text color. CSS selectors like `.hsd` and `.estd` are used for centered text styling.

### Menu Sections

The menu is divided into two sections: "Coffee" and "Desserts." Each section uses a combination of `<div>` containers and CSS classes for styling. Menu items are displayed using nested `<div>` elements with flexbox for layout.

### Horizontal Lines and Footer

The horizontal lines are created using the `<hr>` element with custom CSS styling to match the cafe's design. The footer includes a "Visit our website" link and cafe address. CSS selectors like `.visitwebsite` and `.lastcontent` provide styling.
